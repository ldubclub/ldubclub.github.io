								Who or what is LDUB you ask? Laci Wall aka LDUB
								here. “L” for the Laci and “DUB” for the “W” in
								my last name. I am LDUB and you are the CLUB!
								<br><br>I have a bachelors degree in Human
								Performance & Wellness and a lifelong passion
								for music and dance. LDUB CLUB is a balanced
								blend of dance and fitness. It is a unique,
								high-energy class, full of positive vibes that I
								call dance fitness fun! I believe in being
								active, engaging muscles, building stamina,
								cardio strength and improving mental fitness. I
								started as a Zumba instructor in 2010 and that
								gave me the confidence to eventually do my own
								thing. I came up with LDUB CLUB in 2011, and my
								intention since then has been to create a
								positive comfortable space to “Just Be.”
								<br><br>My path with LDUB CLUB has become more
								clear after experiencing a multitude of health
								issues since birth in 1977. To deal with my gut,
								the insomnia and crippling anxiety growing up, I
								taught myself to dance and played sports.
								Dancing was my medicine and my creative outlet
								that helped me on my journey through life.

                                with a simple line in between-->
								When I say dancing helped me, it was the only
								time that I didn’t have anxiety or feel pain.
								The music came on, I start moving my body and I
								feel pure joy! My purpose now, is to share with
								others the importance of moving your body,
								freeing your energy and learning to find your
								worth. I want to be an example of letting go of
								fear and just dancing it out.
								<br><br>LDUB CLUB is an opportunity for those
								who have never worked out or danced or feel
								anxiety. It’s a space to be you and to feel
								comfortable by doing your version of what I’m
								doing. LDUB CLUB is for anyone that wants to add
								a positive healthy element to their routine.
								<br><br>To see someone invest in themselves and
								transform spirt, mind and body, from something
								that I subconsciously created for my survival,
								is one of the most rewarding feelings I have
								ever felt. For me it’s more than just dance
								fitness, it’s the connections we make, it’s the
								way we support each other to be the best version
								of ourselves that we could possibly be. LDUB
								CLUB is my way of spreading love in this world.
								<br><br>Thank you for reading my story and look
								forward to dancing with you soon!
